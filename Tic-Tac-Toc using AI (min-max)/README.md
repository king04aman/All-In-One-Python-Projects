# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game presents a classic, engaging experience where players can compete against either an AI opponent or another human player. The AI leverages the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm used in game theory, to evaluate potential moves and choose the best possible action at each turn. This guarantees that the AI will always make optimal moves, creating a challenging and competitive environment for players of all skill levels.

### Key Features:
- **Two Players**: Play against an AI or another human player.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI makes optimal moves based on the Minimax strategy.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A simple and intuitive GUI using Pygame.
- **Reset Option**: Restart the game easily at any time.
